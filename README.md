### Here is What I am Working On!ðŸ‘‹

- :information_desk_person: About Me:

  -I am a former IT Security Analyst turned Full Stack Developer who has a realization and passion for turning ideas into reality through technology. 
		
  -My decision to pursue a lifelong career in software development stemmed from my love for dissecting problems and finding solutions to those problems. Software programming allows me to develop solutions that impact our daily lives. 

  -I graduated from an accelerated full-stack development course at Coding Dojo, which equipped me with a proficient knowledge across 3 full-stack of MERN, Python and CSharp (C#). I now have the ability to create end to end applications with a variety of dynamic and interactive projects. 

  -I am seeking opportunities to learn and challenge myself in the software engineering field. My goal is to build products and offer solutions that are user friendly, intuitive and efficient.
